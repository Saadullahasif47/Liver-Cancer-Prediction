# ðŸ§¬ HepaGuard: An AI-Powered Model for Early Detection of Liver Cancer Risk

This project implements a **Machine Learning pipeline** to predict the likelihood 
of liver cancer based on medical features. The model leverages **Random Forest Classifier** 
with optimized preprocessing techniques to achieve high accuracy and is deployed as a web application
using **Flask** and **ngrok**.
